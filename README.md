# 🚇 Metro System Shortest Path Finder

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the Metro System Shortest Path Finder! This web application utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm to help users find the shortest route and calculate the fare between two metro stations. It's designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, making it easy to navigate the Delhi Metro system.

## ✨ Features
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Harnesses the power of Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the quickest route between two stations.
- **Fare Calculation**: Automatically computes the fare based on the distance traveled.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Simple input fields for entering source and destination stations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Clean and responsive design for a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm and handling user interactions.
